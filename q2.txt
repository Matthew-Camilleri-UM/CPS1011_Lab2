1. $4234725.00

2. $4234725.00 - does not change

#include <math.h>

int main() {
    float weight;
    double value;
    printf("Enter your weight in pounds: \n");
    scanf("%f", &weight);
    // Platinum is $1770 / pound
    // 14.5 troy ounces in 1 pound
    value = round(1770.0 * weight * 14.5 * 10000)/10000;
    //multiplies by 10000, rounds to integer, and then divides by the same for 4.dp
    printf ("Your weight in platinum costs $%.4f. \n", value);
}

4.
%f : $0.0000
%d : $4234725

%f looks for a float value in the printf() function but finds none, and uses 0.0000 as a default value (undefined behaviour)

5.
the integer is printed as normal since we are printing the integer with %d, value and not the corresponding character with %c, char(value)
